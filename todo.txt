terrain generation:
create flat terrain
decide how to store terrain info
write function to determine if a pixel status (is it dirt or air?)
vector of pixels? of structs with pixel color/status?
create terrain with one gradual slope
create terrain with many gradual slopes
lookup terrain generation setting to select between diff terrain types
decide how/where to place cannons
add some randomization to cannon placement
