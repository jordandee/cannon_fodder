controls:
allow user to shoot cannon by holding space up to 1 or 2 seconds
have holding space draw enlarging rect to indicate force

gameplay:
make the game alternate between players' turns/shots

cannon ball:
create texture

physics:
implement gravity
test gravity by allowing ball to drop from air
test gravity by simulating fake shot straight into air
test gravity by simulating fake shot angled into air
try out range of shots to figure out sane force values

bugs??:
after adding second slope type, game sometimes slow to close

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

terrain generation:
-create flat terrain
-decide how to store terrain info - vector of pixels with x,y, status
-write function to determine if a pixel status based on a slope
-create terrain with one gradual slope
-create terrain with two gradual slopes
-create terrain with four gradual slopes
-create terrain with four slopes with randomized transition positions
-read settings file at startup to determine terrain type and set global var
-use terrain generation type global var to select between diff terrain types

cannons:
-create cannon texture
-draw cannon on screen
-alter texture loading so that it happens during init, not render
-decide how to implement cannon placement, after terrain gen
-implement function to find top ground pixel at given x
-place a cannon that works with terrain gen
-place second cannon that works with terrain gen
-add some randomization to cannon placement
-split cannons into two parts, wheel and cannon barrel texture
-display cannon as wheel background and cannon shaft foreground
-rotate cannon barrel with arrow keys
