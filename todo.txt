cannons:
alter texture loading so that it happens during init, not render
decide how to implement cannon placement, during or after terrain gen?
place a cannon that works with terrain gen
place second cannon that works with terrain gen
add some randomization to cannon placement

bugs??:
after adding second slope type, game sometimes slow to close


terrain generation:
-create flat terrain
-decide how to store terrain info - vector of pixels with x,y, status
-write function to determine if a pixel status based on a slope
-create terrain with one gradual slope
-create terrain with two gradual slopes
-create terrain with four gradual slopes
-create terrain with four slopes with randomized transition positions
-read settings file at startup to determine terrain type and set global var
-use terrain generation type global var to select between diff terrain types

-create cannon texture
-draw cannon on screen
